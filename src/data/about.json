      "I’m a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with {years_of_experience} years of experience across the full stack. I specialize in building fast, scalable systems using <strong>TypeScript (React/Next.js)</strong> on the front and <strong>Go or Laravel</strong> on the back.",
      "Most of my career has been spent in <strong>Fintech and E-commerce</strong>. I’ve been in the trenches building institutional investment platforms for <strong>Bibit</strong> and managing complex, multi-brand e-commerce architectures for <strong>Central Mega Kencana</strong>. I’m comfortable working where performance and security are non-negotiable.",
      "I don't just 'write code' to clear tickets—I build systems to drive change. Whether it's shipping a design system or optimizing a checkout flow, I care about the <strong>real-world impact</strong> of the software I build."
